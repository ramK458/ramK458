- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ramK458

I work in research and enjoy programming. I am interested in signal processing and environment perception algorithms. 
Most of my experience is in Matlab, python and a little bit of C++. If you have some interesting ideas, or looking for collabs in similar fields, drop a short message.
